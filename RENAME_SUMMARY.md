## Why "Immunoassay Data Pipeline"?

### Advantages:
✅ **Broader scope** - Not limited to just ELISA
✅ **Professional** - Industry-standard terminology
✅ **Expandable** - Can easily add ELORA, Western blot analysis, etc.
✅ **Searchable** - Recruiters search for "immunoassay" skills
✅ **Shows expertise** - Demonstrates understanding of the assay family

### Still Works For:
- ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)
- ELORA (Enzyme-Linked Optical Readout Assay)
- Other plate-based immunoassays
- Any assay using 4PL curve fitting

## Repository Description to Use:

```
Bioinformatics pipeline for immunoassay data processing (ELISA, ELORA, etc.) 
with 4PL curve fitting, automated concentration calculations, and 
publication-quality visualizations
```

## GitHub Topics to Add:

- bioinformatics
- immunoassay
- elisa
- data-analysis
- python
- computational-biology
- curve-fitting
- laboratory-data
- protein-quantification

## Ready to Publish!

The project is now ready to be published to GitHub with the more versatile name `immunoassay-data-pipeline`.

All documentation has been updated consistently throughout the project.
