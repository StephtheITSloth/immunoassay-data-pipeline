Dear [Hiring Manager Name / Hiring Committee],

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Bioinformatics Intern position at [Company Name]. As a Biology senior at Brooklyn College with a unique combination of laboratory research experience and software engineering expertise, I am excited about the opportunity to apply computational methods to solve biological problems at [Company Name].

My background bridges the gap between wet lab and computational biology. During my undergraduate research at LaGuardia Community College, I investigated molecular structures using quantum computing frameworks (QuTiP and QisKit), which sparked my passion for using computational tools to advance biological understanding. This experience taught me the importance of rigorous data analysis and reproducible research practices.

To strengthen my computational skills, I completed a Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly and a Formation fellowship, where I collaborated with senior engineers from Meta, Airbnb, and Amazon. This technical foundation, combined with my biology coursework, positions me uniquely to contribute to [Company Name]'s bioinformatics initiatives.

Recently, I developed an immunoassay data pipeline (https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/immunoassay-data-pipeline) that demonstrates my ability to:
- Process and analyze laboratory data using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Apply statistical methods including four-parameter logistic regression
- Create publication-quality visualizations with Matplotlib
- Write well-tested, production-quality code (16 unit tests, 100% pass rate)
- Document complex workflows for reproducibility

This project showcases the practical skills essential for bioinformatics work: handling experimental data, implementing statistical algorithms, and building robust pipelines that researchers can trust.

I am particularly drawn to [Company Name] because [specific reason - mention their research area, tools, or mission]. I am eager to contribute my skills in [mention relevant skills from job posting: Python, R, data analysis, pipeline development, etc.] while learning from your experienced team. My experience in both laboratory settings and software development allows me to understand both the biological questions being asked and the computational methods needed to answer them.

I am excited about the opportunity to apply my interdisciplinary background to meaningful projects at [Company Name]. I am confident that my combination of biological knowledge, programming skills, and research experience would make me a valuable addition to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with [Company Name]'s needs. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at [Your Phone] or [Your Email].

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

## CUSTOMIZATION NOTES FOR STEPHANE:

### For Each Application, Customize:

1. **Company Research** (Paragraph 4):
   - Research area: "your work on [specific project/disease/technique]"
   - Tools/tech: "experience with [their tech stack]"
   - Mission: "commitment to [their values/goals]"

2. **Relevant Skills** (Paragraph 4):
   Match to job description:
   - Python/R programming
   - Data analysis and visualization
   - Pipeline development
   - Statistical analysis
   - Database management
   - NGS data analysis (if mentioned)
   - Machine learning (if mentioned)

3. **Your GitHub Link** (Paragraph 3):
   Update with actual repository URL once published

### Example Customizations:

**For a genomics company:**
"I am particularly drawn to [Company] because of your innovative work in next-generation sequencing analysis. My experience processing laboratory data and building automated pipelines aligns well with your need for scalable bioinformatics solutions."

**For a pharmaceutical company:**
"I am particularly drawn to [Company] because of your groundbreaking drug discovery research. Having worked with protein quantification data and statistical modeling, I am excited to apply these skills to support your computational chemistry and target identification initiatives."

**For an academic research lab:**
"I am particularly drawn to [Professor/Dr. Name]'s lab because of your research on [specific topic]. My background in both wet lab techniques and computational analysis would allow me to contribute meaningfully to your studies while developing my bioinformatics expertise."

### Additional Tips:

- **Keep it to 1 page maximum**
- **Use specific numbers**: "16 unit tests", "R² = 0.98", "100% pass rate"
- **Show, don't tell**: Link to your GitHub project
- **Match their language**: If they say "pipelines," use "pipelines" not "workflows"
- **Express enthusiasm**: Be genuinely excited about their work
- **Proofread carefully**: Typos are red flags in computational roles

### Alternative Opening (if you have a referral):

"[Referral Name], [their position] at [Company], suggested I reach out regarding the Bioinformatics Intern position. Having discussed [Company's] work in [specific area], I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills in both biology and software engineering to your team."

### Alternative Closing (for follow-up):

"I submitted my application on [date] and wanted to reiterate my strong interest in this position. I believe my unique combination of biology training and software engineering experience would make me a valuable addition to your bioinformatics team. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with [Company's] needs."
